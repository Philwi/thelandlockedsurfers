# The Landlocked Surfers

is now a simple static website built with Vue.Js and Tailwind.
The purpose of this project is to share our experiences during our travels.
Feel free to check the code or add some issues if you want a feature to be build. :)

## Development

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Through Vite there is an almost instant hot reloading for any updates made.

## Deployment

Netlify is offering free hosting for static websites. We use netlify lambda functions to hide the API-Credentiels of Contentful

## CMS

We use Contentful-Headless CMS to get some dynamic content. So my girlfriend can easily add blog posts as well.

## About Me

I am mostly a backend developer trained in ruby on rails. In side projects I like to get to know some other tech stack.
It's been a blast for now.
